## Overview
"Earth 2030: Mission Transcendence" is not just a game; it's an immersive experience that blurs the lines between virtual and real worlds. It's about the human journey, leveraging real-world data and scientific predictions to create a deeply engaging and educational simulation.

## Inspiration
Make a digital autonomous twin of myself and put it in a simulation environment that reflects real world. The goal is to create an agent that you can modify and interact with. The agent has a phone in its loot that makes him able to interact inside and outside the sim-world.

Other NPC should be seen as LLM agents like in [this paper](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2F4-autonomous-ai-agents-you-need-to-know-d612a643fa92&psig=AOvVaw0UEaw3iobx-QQyltElPT-h&ust=1700671609108000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBIQjRxqFwoTCOi4nc3F1YIDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)
